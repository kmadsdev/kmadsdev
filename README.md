# Kaique Souza | Software Engineer
I‚Äôm a 17 year old tech enthusiast with over 7 years of experience in IT, programming, data, and software development. 
Always being so curious about technologies like hardware in an smartphone or a software, my journey started in 2018 when I discovered that I could build my very own Bots on Discord, I started digging into JavaScript using Node.JS and Discord.JS since.
